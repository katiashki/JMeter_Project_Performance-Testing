All tests were executed successfully within defined performance parameters. 
Since there was no information about users quantity and response time lets assume that:
- Expected response time: 2000ms.
- Having 1 user accessing API for 3 times every 10 sec. 

Conclusions: All responses are below expected response time. Average response time is around 190ms.
